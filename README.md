## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world data analysis scenario for a fictional electronics retailer, "TechTrends." The goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable business insights using SQL.

**Key Objectives:**
* Analyze sales performance across product categories.
* Identify high-value customers for loyalty programs.
* Track revenue trends to inform inventory decisions.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **SQL (Structured Query Language):** Used for data extraction, joining, and aggregation.
* **Database Concepts:** Relational Schema, Normalization (3NF).

## 🔍 Key Insights & Queries
The following analysis was performed on the dataset:

### 1. Product Performance
Identified that **Electronics** (Laptops, Smartphones) drive 80% of revenue, while **Accessories** drive higher transaction volume.

### 2. Customer Segmentation
Used `CASE` statements to categorize users:
* **VIP Customers:** Spent > $500 (Target for premium support).
* **Standard Customers:** Spent < $500 (Target for upsell campaigns).

## 📂 Project Structure
* `tech_trends_analysis.sql`: Contains the complete source code, including table creation, data insertion, and analysis queries.

## 🚀 How to Run
You can run the SQL script in any standard SQL environment (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or online compilers like DB Fiddle).
